# HW1_yc2839
The homework contains two parts: fork work (within gittest_Yue) and creating work (EV and alias, within PUI2016_yc2839)  
I worked with XiaoMeng and Cheng Hou  
I did no contributions for I knew almost nothing about it, basically I just followed their steps and tried my best to figure out what they were doing and finally got much learing done through the process.
